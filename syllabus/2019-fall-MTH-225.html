	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
	An introduction to mathematical reasoning. Mathematical logic, including quantification and the predicate calculus is introduced and used to discuss set theory, relations, functions, counting, graphs, and algorithms. Elementary proofs, including proofs by induction are stressed. Prerequisite: grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207. Course not open to those who have credit in CS 225. Offered Fall, Spring.
	
	<!-- 
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	Enter a course overview if different from course catalog description
 	 -->
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	This course inherits students who have done computational mathematics courses (such as algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus) and trains students to be able to take a course in modern mathematics that uses proof as the only method of discourse. Similar courses at other universities are called "bridge" courses or a "transition to advanced mathematics" because the course activities and assessments prepare students who are unfamiliar with proof to be able to understand the proof-based standard in which mathematicians operate.

	<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
	<!-- [enter prerequisites here or state none]-->
	Grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207.

	<h4>Course Learning Outcomes</h4>

	the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/d2l/">D2L homepage</a>.

	<h2>Grading Policies</h2>

	Your overall course grade is determined by the following components, with the weights given:
	
<ul>

	<li>Homework: 20% of your grade. 
		To succeed in this class, you should regularly complete assignments immediately after the topic has been 
		covered in class. Do not always complete assignments at the last minute. Homework is due on Fridays, with 
		one exception: HW00 is a LaTeX training assignment, and is due on Monday, Sep 11 due to the timing of the 
		beginning of the semester. All homework assignments from HW01 through HW13 cover material from the previous 
		week. For instance, HW03 is due on Friday, Sep 29. The last material on HW03 is from Thursday, Sep 21.<br><br>

		Note that Quiz 03 and HW03 have the same material cutoff of Sep 21. HW03 is due on Sep 29 
		(as opposed to on Sep 28 or 27) only so that you have some time to finish minor detials. 
		Sep 27 would NOT be a good day to start HW03. Similarly, Exam 1 and HW04 both have the same cutoff 
		of Sep 28, even though HW04 is due after Exam 1 occurs.</li>

	<li>Blurb: 5% of your grade.
		Blurbs are due every Tuesday, covering a crucial concept, typically from the previous week. 
		A typical blurb will be about a half page, typed in LaTeX. The PDF file made from LaTeX should 
		be uploaded to GradeScope.</li>
	
	<li>Quizzes: 15% of your grade. There are 9 in-class quizzes which will take place in the last 10 minutes of 
		class on Thursdays which do not have an exam, as shown in the calendar (next page). A Thursday quiz 
		will cover up to last Thursday's material. (For example, Quiz 03 has a material cutoff of Sep 21.  
		If you complete HW in a timely manner without waiting until the last minute to start, then you will 
		be on pace for the quizzes.)<br><br>

		The lowest 2 quizzes will be dropped. There are no make-up quizzes, except in extreme 
		circumstances determined by the instructor. The questions from the quizzes are based on the homework.</li>
	
	<li>In-class exams: 40% of your grade.
		Other than the final, there are three in-class exams of 55 minutes, each of equal weight:

		<ul>
			<li>Exam 1 (on Thr Oct 5) covers material from Sep 5 through the end of class on Sep 28.</li>
			<li>Exam 2 (on Thr Oct 26) covers material from Sep 5 through the end of class on Oct 19, with emphasis on material after Sep 28.</li>
			<li>Exam 3 (on Thr Nov 16) covers material from Sep 5 through the end of class on Nov 9, with emphasis on material after Oct 19.</li>
		</ul>
			
		While exams generally emphasize later material, mathematics is inherently cumulative so the {\bf exams are cumulative too}.
		Exams must be taken on the scheduled day unless prior arrangements have been made for extreme circumstances.</li>

	<li>Final Exam: 20% of your grade.
		The final exam is comprehensive (covers all sections which we covered).
		In accordance with the 
		<a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/records/faculty-staff-resources/final-exam-schedule/#tab-fall-2017">final exam schedule</a>,
		the final exam is on Monday, December 18, 2017. 
		The exam starts at 7:45am and is two hours long. 
		In accordance with the growth mindset policy of this class, 
		if your percentage on the final is higher than your percentage on an in-class exam, 
		the score for one of your in-class exams will be replaced with the final exam percentage.

	</ul>

	<h3>Expectations for homework in upper-level classes</h3>
	All homework assignments are due on Fridays.
	You will need to submit two files to two separate locations.
	All homework must be completed using \(\LaTeX\), with no exceptions.
	The <tt>.tex</tt> file you submit must compile without errors.
	(Warnings from TeX are okay, but errors are not.)
	The <tt>.tex</tt> file should be submitted in the D2L Dropbox.
	The PDF file should be submitted to GradeScope.
	The PDF submitted to grade scope should have each numbered homework question on its own page:
	when submitting the PDF, identify which page corresponds to which question.

	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/do-homework.jpg'"><br>

	<h3>Expectations for blurbs in upper-level classes</h3>
	All blurbs must be completed using \(\LaTeX\), with no exceptions.
	The <tt>.tex</tt> file you create must compile without errors.
	(Warnings from TeX are okay, but errors are not.)
	Unlike for the homework assignments, you will only turn in the PDF for blurbs, not the LaTeX file.
	The PDF file should be submitted to GradeScope.

	<h3>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h3>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability 
	to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible.

	<!-- [explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate 
	Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work] -->

	If a situation should arise (e.g., ill on an exam day), please notify me by e-mail as soon as possible:
	a determination of alternate arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis, but the instructor has the final determination
	for what absences are eligible, which is why it is important to alert the instructor as soon as you know of an absence
	which would affect an assignment deadline or test date.

	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/late-work.jpg'"><br>


	<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
	There are no points in the course grading policies assigned to attendance or participation. Though attendance and 
	participation do not have a direct effect on your grade, attendance and participation are required for success with 
	homeworks, quizzes, and exams. I strongly recommend that you attend and participate every class session! If you have 
	any extenuating circumstance that may prevent full attendance or participation, please let me know as soon as possible.

	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/attendance.jpg'"><br>

	<h3>Expectations for Graded Work</h3>
	<div>I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading.  Generally, I return 
		work that requires individual feedback within 21 days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am 
		unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work 
		after the due date, it may not be accepted for credit, and it may not be returned within 21 days.</div>
 
	<div>The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 
		14 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it will not be 
		accepted for credit except under extreme circumstances determined by the instructor.</div>
 
	<div>Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, 
		via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades, or using Gradescope.
		Assignments will be returned as soon as possible but due to the nature of mathematics assignments (especially where 
		a consecutive assignment can be started prior to the previous assignment being due), it is not possible to return 
		work prior to a similar assignment being due, but you should generally have returned work with feedback within the 
		subsequent assignment being due.</div>

	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/feedback.jpg'"><br>


	<h3>Grading Scale</h3>

	To be guaranteed a given grade, a student needs to obtain at least the following overall percentage:

	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>Letter Grade</td><td>Minimum Percentage</td></tr>
		<tr><td>A</td><td>91%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>AB</td><td>88%</td></tr>

	<h2>How to learn mathematics</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>As you do mathematics, work on explaining what you are doing in complete sentences. Avoid using the word "it".</li>
		<li>There is no replacement for your effort.</li>
		<li>Do not work on things last minute.</li>
		<li>Keep an honest and accurate log of your study time for class. Be sure to "clock out" when your mind wanders to something else (social media, etc.)</li>
		<li>Take thorough notes in class. If it's written on the board, be sure to have it written in your notebook.</li>
		<li>Review your notebook after every class. The best way to review your notebook is to write a new copy of everything you wrote in your original notebook. This gives you the chance to review, and if even notice when you don't fully understand something. If you notice that you don't fully understand something, drop by office hours and ask for clarification.</li>
		<li>Get help at the first sign of trouble: office hours are times reserved for you to get help. It is normal to use office hours!</li>
		<li>Be sure to read the book section to supplement the things we discuss in class.</li>
		<li>Each day's class is likely to rely on the previous day's material: it is not a good habit to wait to do homework until the day it is due (or the day before).</li>
		<li>Commit to learning something soon after it is discussed in class: then you earn points for it on a quiz, an exam, a later exam, and a final. If you learn it only later, you can only earn points for it later.</li>
		<li>It is not a secret to me that Google exists. If you use these resources, you remove the struggle for yourself and it will reflect in your quizzes and exams.</li>
		<li>Mathematics requires attention to detail, and use of precise mathematical notation and wording. These things are important to me as I assess your work, so please make them important to you.</li>
		<li>If you commit yourself to understanding each topic in time, then you don't really have to "study" for an exam. If you commit to only "halfway understanding" each topic, then you will need to spend an unnecesary amount of time before each exam "studying", but this cramming does not lead to in-depth knowledge or long-term recall.</li>
	</ul>
