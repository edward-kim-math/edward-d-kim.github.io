	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
	An introduction to mathematical reasoning. Mathematical logic, including quantification and the predicate calculus is introduced and used to discuss set theory, relations, functions, counting, graphs, and algorithms. Elementary proofs, including proofs by induction are stressed. Prerequisite: grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207. Course not open to those who have credit in CS 225. Offered Fall, Spring.

	<h4>Overview</h4>

	<h4>Overview</h4>
	This course inherits students who have done computational mathematics courses (such as algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus) and trains students to be able to take a course in modern mathematics that uses proof as the only method of discourse. Similar courses at other universities are called "bridge" courses or a "transition to advanced mathematics" because the course activities and assessments prepare students who are unfamiliar with proof to be able to understand the proof-based standard in which mathematicians operate.

	<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
	<!-- [enter prerequisites here or state none]-->
	Grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207.

	<h4>Course Learning Outcomes</h4>
	<!-- 225 objectives From CIM -->

	<ul>
		<li>Understand the language and symbolism used in logic and proofs.</li>
		<li>Apply various proof techniques including direct, indirect, contradiction, induction and cases.</li>
		<li>Construct proofs of logical and including set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics and number theory.</li>

	<h4>Format</h4>
	This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the learning 
	management system, Desire2Learn (D2L). If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the course from 
	the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/d2l/">D2L homepage</a>.

	<h2>Grading Policies</h2>
	Calculations [modify as needed to describe how you calculate grades]
	Your overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value.
	Assignment	Points (per assignment)	#	Total % Final Grade<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Total Value		100%<br>

	<h3>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h3>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability 
	to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. 

	[explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate 
	Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work]

	<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
	There are no points in the course grading policies assigned to attendance or participation. Though attendance and 
	participation do not have a direct effect on your grade, attendance and participation are required for success with 
	homeworks, quizzes, and exams. I strongly recommend that you attend and participate every class session! If you have 
	any extenuating circumstance that may prevent full attendance or participation, please let me know as soon as possible.

	<h3>Expectations for Graded Work</h3>
	<div>I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading.  Generally, I return 
		work that requires individual feedback within 21 days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am 
		unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work 
		after the due date, it may not be accepted for credit, and it may not be returned within 21 days.</div>
 
	<div>The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 
		14 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it will not be 
		accepted for credit except under extreme circumstances determined by the instructor.</div>
 
	<div>Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, 
		via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades, or using Gradescope.
		Assignments will be returned as soon as possible but due to the nature of mathematics assignments (especially where 
		a consecutive assignment can be started prior to the previous assignment being due), it is not possible to return 
		work prior to a similar assignment being due, but you should generally have returned work with feedback within the 
		subsequent assignment being due.</div>

	<h3>Grading Scale</h3>

	To be guaranteed a given grade, a student needs to obtain at least the following overall percentage:

	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>Letter Grade</td><td>Minimum Percentage</td></tr>
		<tr><td>A</td><td>91%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>AB</td><td>88%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>B</td><td>82%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>BC</td><td>78%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>C</td><td>70%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>D</td><td>60%</td></tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Course Outline and Schedule</h2>
	Please note that the timing of activities and topics listed below may change.
	I will give you timely notice of any major changes in the syllabus through email, on D2L, in class, or some combination 
	of methods.
