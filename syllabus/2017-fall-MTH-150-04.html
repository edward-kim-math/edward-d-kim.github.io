	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
	A college algebra course on the properties, graphs, and applications of elementary functions. Topics include the real and complex numbers, concepts from analytic geometry, solutions to equations and inequalities, the elementary algebraic functions, and the logarithmic and exponential functions. Prerequisite: MTH 051 or two years of high school algebra and an appropriate placement test score. (Successful completion of MTH 151, MTH 175, or MTH 207 precludes taking MTH 150 for credit.) Offered Fall, Spring, Summer.

	MTH 051 or two years of high school algebra and an appropriate placement test score.
  
	<h4>Course Learning Outcomes</h4>
	<!-- 15 objectives self-written  -->
	Students will develop an understanding of and appreciation for the theory and applications of algebra. Specifically, by the end of this course, you will be able to:
	<ul>
  <li>simplify and rewrite expressions involving fractions, decimals, exponents, radicals, and logarithms using algebraic identities</li>
  <li>translate applied problems into algebraic equations and interpret the solution in context</li>
  <li>solve equations and inequalities involving absolute values, polynomials, fractions, decimals, exponents, radicals, and logarithms</li>
  <li>complete the square on \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) to obtain the Quadratic Formula</li>
  <li>understand the concepts of functions, including input, output, domain, range, operations, compositions, and inverses</li>
  <li>apply the connection between a function and its graph to answer questions about intercepts and zeroes</li>
  <li>construct the graphs of standard functions (linear, quadratic, square root, exponential, logarithm, absolute value, etc.) and apply graph transformations</li>
  <li>find roots of a polynomial using standard techniques such as polynomial long division</li>
  <li>explain the relationship between functions and their inverses, especially in the context of logarithms</li>
	</ul>

  <h4>General Education Program</h4>
  MTH 150 is a course in the `Mathematics' list of <a href="http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/generaleducation/#generaleducationrequirementstext">GE 02</a>.
	
	<h4>Format</h4>
	This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the learning 
	management system, Desire2Learn (D2L). If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the course from 
	the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/d2l/">D2L homepage</a>.

	<h2>Grading Policies</h2>
	Calculations [modify as needed to describe how you calculate grades]
	Your overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value.
	Assignment	Points (per assignment)	#	Total % Final Grade<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Item	Points each/Points total		%<br>
	Total Value		100%<br>

	<h3>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h3>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability 
	to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. 

	[explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate 
	Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work]

	<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
	There are no points in the course grading policies assigned to attendance or participation. Though attendance and 
	participation do not have a direct effect on your grade, attendance and participation are required for success with 
	homeworks, quizzes, and exams. I strongly recommend that you attend and participate every class session! If you have 
	any extenuating circumstance that may prevent full attendance or participation, please let me know as soon as possible.

	<h3>Expectations for Graded Work</h3>
	<div>I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading.  Generally, I return 
		work that requires individual feedback within 21 days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am 
		unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work 
		after the due date, it may not be accepted for credit, and it may not be returned within 21 days.</div>
 
	<div>The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 
		14 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it will not be 
		accepted for credit except under extreme circumstances determined by the instructor.</div>
 
	<div>Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, 
		via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades, or using Gradescope.
		Assignments will be returned as soon as possible but due to the nature of mathematics assignments (especially where 
		a consecutive assignment can be started prior to the previous assignment being due), it is not possible to return 
		work prior to a similar assignment being due, but you should generally have returned work with feedback within the 
		subsequent assignment being due.</div>

	<h3>Grading Scale</h3>

	To be guaranteed a given grade, a student needs to obtain at least the following overall percentage:

	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>Letter Grade</td><td>Minimum Percentage</td></tr>
		<tr><td>A</td><td>91%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>AB</td><td>88%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>B</td><td>82%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>BC</td><td>78%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>C</td><td>70%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>D</td><td>60%</td></tr>
