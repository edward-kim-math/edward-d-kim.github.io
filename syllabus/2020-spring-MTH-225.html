	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
	An introduction to mathematical reasoning. Mathematical logic, including quantification and the predicate calculus is introduced and used to discuss set theory, relations, functions, counting, graphs, and algorithms. Elementary proofs, including proofs by induction are stressed. Prerequisite: grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207. Course not open to those who have credit in CS 225. Offered Fall, Spring.
	
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	This course inherits students who have done computational mathematics courses (such as algebra, trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus) and trains students to be able to take a course in modern mathematics that uses proof as the only method of discourse. Similar courses at other universities are called "bridge" courses or a "transition to advanced mathematics" because the course activities and assessments prepare students who are unfamiliar with proof to be able to understand the proof-based standard in which mathematicians operate.

	<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
	<!-- [enter prerequisites here or state none]-->
	Grade of "C" or better in MTH 175 or MTH 207.

	<h4>Course Learning Outcomes</h4>
	<!-- 225 objectives From CIM -->
	By the end of this course, you will be able to:
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the language and symbolism used in logic and proofs.</li>
		<li>Apply various proof techniques including direct, indirect, contradiction, induction and cases.</li>
		<li>Construct proofs of logical and including set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics and number theory.</li>
		<li>Recognize and apply the appropriate proof strategy in a variety of mathematical areas.</li>
	</ul>

  Additional outcomes: by the end of this course, you will also be able to:
  <ul>
    <li>Write mathematics (definitions, proofs, explanations) following standard modern mathematical practice.</li>
    <li>Critique incorrect mathematical writing (definitions, proofs, explanations), informed by mathematical definitions.</li>
    <li>Interpret newly-presented definitions and apply such definitions to construct examples and non-examples.</li>
    <li>Interpret newly-presented definitions and apply such definitions to prove newly-presented theorem statements.</li>
  </ul>

	<h4>Materials and Tools</h4>
	The primary textbook for this class is E. Kim, <i>Handbook of Mathematical Proof</i>, <a href="https://edward-kim-math.github.io/resources/handbook-of-mathematical-proof.pdf">available online</a>.
	The secondary Textbook is Kenneth H. Rosen, <i>Discrete Mathematics and its Applications</i>. 5th Edition. McGraw-Hill.
	
	<!-- Note whether available from Textbook Rental or need to be purchased. -->
	The textbooks will be available from Textbook Rental.

	<h4>Format</h4>
	This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the learning 
	management system, Canvas. If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the course from 
	the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/canvas/">Canvas homepage</a>.

	<h2>Grading Policies</h2>

	Your overall course grade is determined by the following components, with the weights given:
	
<ul>

	<li>Homework: 20% of your grade. 
		To succeed in this class, you should regularly complete assignments immediately after the topic has been 
		covered in class. Do not always complete assignments at the last minute.
		With the exception of HW 00, homework is due on Thursdays. 
		HW00 is a LaTeX training assignment. HW00 is due on Tuesday, February 4.
		There are 13 homeworks (numbered 00 to 12).<br><br>

		HW01 due on Thursday, February 6 will cover material up to the previous Thursday (January 30).
		That is to say, after class on January 30, you can fully complete HW01, so do not wait until Feb 4 or 5 to start it.
		As soon as you turn in one HW on a Thursday, you will have all the tools and class sessions to complete the next HW.<br><br>
		
		Solutions to HW will be posted online on Fridays, so that you will be able to look at it before the following Tuesday's quiz.	
	</li>

	<li>Responses: 4% of your grade.
		Reading responses (called 'responses' for brevity) are due every Wednesday, starting February 5.
		Because the mathematics in MTH 225 is very different from your experience in calculation-based math courses,
		responses are short (quarter to half-page) active learning assignments which focus on active reading,
		illuminating key concepts, and deepening understanding in ways that homework exercises cannot.
		The PDF file made from LaTeX should be uploaded to Canvas as an assignment submission. (Please do not turn this in as a Canvas comment.)</li>

	<li>Math is a process: 2% of your grade. There are two portions to this grade. The exercises here are meant to help you discover mathematical learning processes that work for you, and that the processes/strategies you use may continue to evolve and improve as the semester moves on.
		<ul>
			<li>Half of the points (100 points) are assigned to an office hour visit. For credit, the office hour must occur in Dr. Kim's office (instead of the learning center) and must be documented by filling out a form (available in the office). 200 out of 100 points (so, extra credit worth 1% of the course grade) will be awarded for visiting in the first 7 weeks of the semester. 100 out of 100 points will be awarded for visiting in the second 7 weeks of the semester -- the visit must occur before the last day of classes and before final exams start.</li>
			<li>Half of the points (100 points) are assigned to 4 short write-ups, each due the day before an exam date. (See more about the "math is a process" pre-exam write-ups in Canvas.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	
	<li>Quizzes: 14% of your grade. There are 11 in-class quizzes which will take place in the last 10 minutes of 
		class on Tuesdays which do not have an exam, as shown in the calendar. A Tuesday quiz 
		will cover up to last last Thursday's material. (For example, Quiz 03 on Feb 25 has a material cutoff of Feb 13, the same as HW 03.)
		If you complete HW in a timely manner without waiting until the last minute to start, then you will 
		be on pace for the quizzes.) There are 13 quizzes (12 in-class, with Quiz 00 being a video introduction).<br><br>

		Quiz 00 is a video to get to know you, and is due on Friday, Feb 7.<br><br>
		
		The lowest 2 quizzes will be dropped. There are no make-up quizzes, except in extreme 
		circumstances determined by the instructor. The questions from the quizzes are based on the homework.</li>
	
	<li>In-class exams: 40% of your grade.
		Other than the final, there are three in-class exams of 55 minutes, each of equal weight:
		<ul>
			<li>Exam 1 (on Thr Feb 27) covers material from Jan 27 through the end of class on Feb 20.</li>
			<li>Exam 2 (on Thr <b>Apr 2</b>) covers material from Jan 27 through the end of class on Mar 12, with emphasis on material after Feb 20.</li>
			<li>Exam 3 (on Thr <b>Apr 30</b>) covers material from Jan 27 through the end of class on Apr 23, with emphasis on material after Mar 12.</li>
		</ul>
		While exams generally emphasize later material, mathematics is inherently cumulative so exams are cumulative too.
		Exams must be taken on the scheduled day unless prior arrangements have been made for extreme circumstances.</li>

	<li>Final Exam: 20% of your grade.
		The final exam is comprehensive (covers all sections which we covered).
		In accordance with the 
		<a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/records/faculty-staff-resources/final-exam-schedule/">final exam schedule</a>,
		the final exam is on Friday, May 15, 2020. 
		The exam starts at 10:00am and is two hours long. 
		In accordance with the growth mindset policy of this class, 
		if your percentage on the final is higher than your percentage on an in-class exam, 
		the score for one of your in-class exams will be replaced with the final exam percentage.
		<b>Information about the final exam is subject to change, depending on the policies set by campus due to recent news.</b>
	</ul>

	<h3>Expectations for homework in upper-level classes</h3>
	All homework must be completed using \(\LaTeX\), with no exceptions.
	The PDF file should be submitted to GradeScope.
	The PDF submitted to GradeScope should have each numbered homework question on its own page:
	after uploading the PDF but before the final submit button,
	please use the on-screen tools to identify which page corresponds to which question.

	<h3>Expectations for reading responses in upper-level classes</h3>
	All reading responses must be completed using \(\LaTeX\), with no exceptions.
	The PDF file should be submitted to Canvas in the appropriate assignment area. Do not submit a file as a comment.

	<h3>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h3>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability 
	to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible.

	<!-- [explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate 
	Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work] -->

	If a situation should arise (e.g., ill on an exam day), please notify me by e-mail as soon as possible:
	a determination of alternate arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis, but the instructor has the final determination
	for what absences are eligible, which is why it is important to alert the instructor as soon as you know of an absence
	which would affect an assignment deadline or test date.

	<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
	There are no points in the course grading policies assigned to attendance or participation. Though attendance and 
	participation do not have a direct effect on your grade, attendance and participation are required for success with 
	homeworks, quizzes, and exams. I strongly recommend that you attend and participate every class session! If you have 
	any extenuating circumstance that may prevent full attendance or participation, please let me know as soon as possible.

	<h3>Expectations for Graded Work</h3>
	<div>I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading.  Generally, I return 
		work that requires individual feedback within 21 days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am 
		unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work 
		after the due date, it may not be accepted for credit, and it may not be returned within 21 days.</div>
 
	<div>The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 
		14 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it will not be 
		accepted for credit except under extreme circumstances determined by the instructor.</div>
 
	<div>Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, 
		via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades, or using Gradescope.
		Assignments will be returned as soon as possible but due to the nature of mathematics assignments (especially where 
		a consecutive assignment can be started prior to the previous assignment being due), it is not possible to return 
		work prior to a similar assignment being due, but you should generally have returned work with feedback within the 
		subsequent assignment being due.</div>

	<h3>Grading Scale</h3>

	To be guaranteed a given grade, a student needs to obtain at least the following overall percentage:
	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>Letter Grade</td><td>Minimum Percentage</td></tr>
		<tr><td>A</td><td>91%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>AB</td><td>88%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>B</td><td>82%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>BC</td><td>78%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>C</td><td>70%</td></tr>
		<tr><td>D</td><td>60%</td></tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	Final grades are not rounded up, whether automatically or by student request.

	
	<h2>Course Outline and Schedule</h2>
	Please note that the timing of activities and topics listed below may change.
	I will give you timely notice of any major changes in the syllabus through email, on Canvas, in class, or some combination

	<h2>How to learn mathematics</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>As you do mathematics, work on explaining what you are doing in complete sentences. Avoid using the word "it".</li>
		<li>There is no replacement for your effort.</li>
		<li>Do not work on things last minute.</li>
		<li>Keep an honest and accurate log of your study time for class. Be sure to "clock out" when your mind wanders to something else (social media, etc.)</li>
		<li>Take thorough notes in class. If it's written on the board, be sure to have it written in your notebook.</li>
		<li>Review your notebook after every class. The best way to review your notebook is to write a new copy of everything you wrote in your original notebook. This gives you the chance to review, and if even notice when you don't fully understand something. If you notice that you don't fully understand something, drop by office hours and ask for clarification.</li>
		<li>Get help at the first sign of trouble: office hours are times reserved for you to get help. It is normal to use office hours!</li>
		<li>Be sure to read the book section to supplement the things we discuss in class.</li>
		<li>Each day's class is likely to rely on the previous day's material: it is not a good habit to wait to do homework until the day it is due (or the day before).</li>
		<li>Commit to learning something soon after it is discussed in class: then you earn points for it on a quiz, an exam, a later exam, and a final. If you learn it only later, you can only earn points for it later.</li>
		<li>It is not a secret to me that Google exists. If you use these resources, you remove the struggle for yourself and it will reflect in your quizzes and exams.</li>
		<li>Mathematics requires attention to detail, and use of precise mathematical notation and wording. These things are important to me as I assess your work, so please make them important to you.</li>
		<li>If you commit yourself to understanding each topic in time, then you don't really have to "study" for an exam. If you commit to only "halfway understanding" each topic, then you will need to spend an unnecesary amount of time before each exam "studying", but this cramming does not lead to in-depth knowledge or long-term recall.</li>
	</ul>
