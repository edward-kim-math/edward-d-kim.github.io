	<h3>Course Description</h3>

	<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
	Students in this course will individually and collaboratively pursue the question "What does it mean to be an educated person?" Consideration of this question will include exploration of the skills, habits of mind, and environments necessary for a lifetime of learning. Specifically, students will consider the college experience as an opportunity to become a more educated person, and the strategies and practices that will assist students in taking full advantage of a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse education. The course will focus on various elements of college success, including study skills, community building, and meaningful academic experiences. Offered Fall.

  <h4>General Education Program</h4>
	This course credit (in UWL 100) counts in the  general education requirement Self and society: understanding oneself and the social world (GE 06). From the catalog: Each person, although unique, lives in a social world that exerts profound influence upon his or her attitudes, values, and behavior. It is important to gain a sound understanding of oneself in relation to others and an understanding of the social institutions that people create and which serve to influence our lives. Courses in this area focus on the study of human behavior and social institutions.
	
	<h4>Format</h4>
	This is a face-to-face course. You may be asked to reference materials or participate online through the learning 
	management system, Desire2Learn (D2L). If that is the case, you will need your UWL NetID to login to the course from 
	the <a href="http://www.uwlax.edu/d2l/">D2L homepage</a>.

	<h3>Grading Policies</h3>
	Your overall course grade is determined by the following components, with the weights given:

	<ul>

	<li></li>
	</ul>
		
	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/turn-in-all-the-things.jpg'"><br>

	<h4>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h4>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability 
	to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. 

	<!-- [explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate 
	Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work] -->

	If a situation should arise (e.g., ill on an exam day), please notify me by e-mail as soon as possible:
	a determination of alternate arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis, but the instructor has the final determination
	for what absences are eligible, which is why it is important to alert the instructor as soon as you know of an absence
	which would affect an assignment deadline or test date.

	<h4>Attendance and Participation</h4>
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	If you grade class participation, indicate how participation differs from attendance and include participation in the grade calculation.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
		
	There are no points in the course grading policies assigned to attendance or participation. Though attendance and 
	participation do not have a direct effect on your grade, attendance and participation are required for success with 
	homeworks, quizzes, and exams. I strongly recommend that you attend and participate every class session! If you have 
	any extenuating circumstance that may prevent full attendance or participation, please let me know as soon as possible.

	<h3>Expectations for Graded Work</h3>
	<div>I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading.  Generally, I return 
		work that requires individual feedback within 21 days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am 
		unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work 
		after the due date, it may not be accepted for credit, and it may not be returned within 21 days.</div><br>
 
	<div>The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 
		14 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it will not be 
		accepted for credit except under extreme circumstances determined by the instructor.</div><br>
 
	<div>Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, 
		via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades.</div><br>

	<br><img src="/img/happy16.png" onclick="this.src='/img/feedback.jpg'"><br>
