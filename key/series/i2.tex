Does $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1}$
diverge, converge absolutely, or converge conditionally?

\subsection*{Solution}

Note that $3n^5 \geq n^5$. In fact, it is even further the case that
\[3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1 \geq n^5\]
and dividing both sides by $(n^5)(3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1)$, we get
\[ \frac1{n^5} \geq \frac{1}{3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1}.\]
Since the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{n^5}$ converges by the $p$-series test, the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1}$ converges by the Direct Comparison Test.

Since $\sum |a_n| = \sum a_n$, the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3n^5+n^4+n^3+n^2+n+1}$ converges absolutely.

\subsection*{Comment}

This series can be studied using the Limit Comparison Test as well, but this is much more convenient using the Direct Comparison Test.

Since $\sum |a_n| = \sum a_n$, the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty AAAAAAAAAAAAAA$ converges absolutely.

Since $|r| < 1$, the series ...  converges by the Geometric Series Test.

Since $|r| \geq 1$, the series ...  diverges by the Geometric Series Test.

The function $f(x)=\frac{}{}$ is continuous, positive, and decreasing on $[1,\infty)$.
