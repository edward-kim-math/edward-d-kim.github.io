Does $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$
diverge, converge absolutely, or converge conditionally?

\subsection*{Solution 1}

The series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$ is an alternating series. Note $b_n = |a_n| = \frac1{n^2}$. Since the sequence $b_n$ is decreasing and $b_n \to 0$, by the Alternating Series Test, $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$ converges.

To figure out whether $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$ converges absolutely or conditionally, we consider the series
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left|\frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}\right|
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
which converges by the $p$-test, so the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$ converges absolutely.

\subsection*{Solution 2}

We consider 
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left|\frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}\right|
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
which converges by the $p$-test, so the series  $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$  converges by the Absolute Convergence Test. In fact, the series  $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos \pi n}{n^2}$  converges absolutely.

\begin{align*}
L&=\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{\left| \right|}\\
\end{align*}


Since $\sum |a_n| = \sum a_n$, the series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty AAAAAAAAAAAAAA$ converges absolutely.

Since $|r| < 1$, the series ...  converges by the Geometric Series Test.

Since $|r| \geq 1$, the series ...  diverges by the Geometric Series Test.

The function $f(x)=\frac{}{}$ is continuous, positive, and decreasing on $[1,\infty)$.
