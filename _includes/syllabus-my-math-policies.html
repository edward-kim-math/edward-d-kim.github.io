<p>While I wish that none of you would have to endure a traumatic situation throughout the semester, the difficult reality that I recognize is that things will come up. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are all real. Large, impactful events occur in the lives of students. If a situation arises, I am committed to connecting you to resources available on campus. Within the classroom policies, I will determine if and how to amend class components/policies to create an equitable situation: typically (though not always) this may come in the form of some sort of due date extension. There is a fine balance between ensuring that students are not merely trying to take advantage of a compassionate course clause (due to mismanaging time) versus a truly extenuating circumstance that a student has. As such, I will review any requests related to the compassionate course clause on a case-by-case basis. The goal of this clause is to minimize the impact that trauma, emergency events, and/or mental health concerns adversely affect your success in this mathematics classroom. The goal of my compassionate course clause is to allow for course policy accommodations that are commensurate to any given situation, while still maintaining high academic standards through assessment of course learning outcomes.</p>


<h2>Getting help</h2>
When you are stuck with math, please get help!
Visit regularly-scheduled office hours (no appointment needed).
If these times don't work, please e-mail about scheduling an appointment for time outside regularly-scheduled office hours.
E-mail is not a good format for discussing mathematics, so visit office hours instead!
Mathematical questions will not be answered on the day of a test:
the five minutes before a test starts is not an appropriate time to ask a math question.

<h2>General expectations</h2>
I am committed to your success.
To reach success, there is no substitute for your hard work.
I value your effort much more than I value getting it right the first time around.
I want you to grow and learn this semester, and I hope you will adopt my stance on growth mindset.
Ask questions!
Embrace mistakes as an opportunity to learn.
