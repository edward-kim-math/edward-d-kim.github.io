	<h2>Grading Policies</h2>
Calculations [modify as needed to describe how you calculate grades]
Your overall grade consists of the following assessments, arranged by type and value.
Assignment	Points (per assignment)	#	Total % Final Grade
Item	Points each/Points total		%
Item	Points each/Points total		%
Item	Points each/Points total		%
Item	Points each/Points total		%
Item	Points each/Points total		%
Total Value		100%


	<h3>Late Assignments, Missed Exams</h3>
	Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule. For extenuating circumstances that impact your ability to meet deadlines or participate in class activities, you are responsible for alerting me as soon as possible. 

[explain how students should notify you if they are, e.g., ill on an exam day, and, as required by the Faculty Senate Syllabus Policy, your policy on missed course work, including exams or other graded in-class work]
Attendance and Participation
[Faculty Senate’s syllabus policy requires that you explain how attendance/absences will affect a student’s grade, and recommends that you explain how/whether students can make up missed work.  For online courses, define what “attendance” means, especially if you distinguish that from “participation.” Explain your expectations for participating in the course, whether it is online, in-person, or hybrid.] 

[If you grade class participation, indicate how participation differs from attendance and include participation in the grade calculation ]
Expectations for Graded Work 
I provide students feedback and/or scores on assignments that require individualized grading before a further assignment of a similar format is due.  Generally, I return work that requires individual feedback within 21* days from the date the work was due. I will notify you if I am unable to grade the work within the 21-day timeframe, and will identify a revised return date. If you submit work after the due date, it may not be returned within 21 days.
 
The grades for any work that is graded electronically, such as scanned examinations, will be accessible to you within 7 days of the due date for the work. If you submit electronically graded work after the due date, it may not be accessible within 7 days. 
 
Your graded coursework will be returned in compliance with FERPA regulations, such as in class, during my office hours, or via the course management system through which only you will have access to your grades.
*Note to UWL instructors: You may indicate a number of days that is appropriate to your teaching in your syllabus.  There is no reason to promise that work will be returned by the next class period even if that is your habit. Give yourself a cushion in terms of expectations.  However, in terms of good practice, 21 days would be the absolute latest students should traditionally receive graded feedback. The key element here is the return of work prior to a similar assignment being due.
Grading Scale [modify as needed—delete Point Value column if not used]

Letter Grade	Point Value	Percentage Equivalent
A		93-100%
AB		89-92%
B		83-88%
BC		79-82%
C		70-78%
D		60-69%
F		59% - below

	<h2>UWL Policies & Supports</h2>
Academic Integrity & Misconduct
Academic misconduct is a violation of the UWL Student Honor Code (http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/studentconduct/) and is unacceptable. I expect you to submit your own original work and participate in the course with integrity and high standards of academic honesty. When appropriate, cite original sources, following the style rules of our discipline.

Plagiarism or cheating in any form may result in failure of the assignment or the entire course, and may include harsher sanctions. Refer to the Student Handbook #14.02 https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/student-resources/student-handbook/#tm-academic-misconduct--chapter-uws-14-) for a detailed definition of academic misconduct. 

For helpful information on how to avoid plagiarism, go to “Avoiding Plagiarism” on the Murphy Library website (http://libguides.uwlax.edu/plagiarism2).  You may also visit the Office of Student Life (https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/) if you have questions about plagiarism or cheating incidents. Failure to understand what constitutes plagiarism or cheating is not a valid excuse for engaging in academic misconduct. 
Concerns or Complaints
If you have a concern or a complaint about the course, or me, I encourage you to bring that to my attention. My hope would be that by communicating your concern we would be able to come to a resolution. If you are uncomfortable speaking with me, or you feel your concern hasn’t been resolved after bringing it to my attention, you can contact my department chair [provide contact info].

The Student Academic Non-Grade Appeals process can be found in the Student Handbook (https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/student-resources/student-handbook/#tm-non-academic-misconduct--chapter-uws-17-).  For more information on appealing a final grade, see http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/gradesgradingtesting/#appeal-final-grade in the Undergraduate Catalog. 
Course Access [modify as needed] 
Access to course materials in D2L may cease after the term ends. If you wish to archive materials for your personal records or portfolio you should do so as you progress through the course. As a general rule, you should always save local copies of course-related work. To avoid disasters, you should also save important files to external media or cloud storage.
Eagle Alert System
This class will be participating in the Eagle Alert System https://www.uwlax.edu/academic-advising-center/eagle-alert/student-resources/ through WINGS. The system is designed to promote student success. If I notice that you are experiencing difficulties early in the semester (e.g., low assignment scores or limited participation), I may note this information and you will receive an email indicating that I have entered feedback. I may also enter positive feedback encouraging you to consider additional learning opportunities. The link in the email will take you to WINGS where you can login to see the feedback. I encourage you to meet with me and/or refer to the helpful campus resources listed below under Academic Services and Resources and on UWL’s Student Success page https://www.uwlax.edu/info/student-success/. 
Inclusive Excellence
UWL’s core values include “Diversity, equity, and the inclusion and engagement of all people in a safe campus climate that embraces and respects the innumerable different perspectives found within an increasingly integrated and culturally diverse global community" (https://www.uwlax.edu/chancellor/mission/). If you are not experiencing my class in this manner, please come talk to me about your experiences so I can try to adjust the course if possible.   
Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI)
UWL conducts student evaluations electronically. Approximately 2 weeks prior to the conclusion of a course, you will receive an email at your UWL email address directing you to complete an evaluation for each of your courses. In-class time will be provided for students to complete the evaluation in class. Electronic reminders will be sent if you do not complete the evaluation. The evaluation will include numerical ratings and, depending on the department, may provide options for comments. The university takes student feedback very seriously and the information gathered from student evaluations is more valuable when a larger percentage of students complete the evaluation. Please be especially mindful to complete the surveys.

Success as an Online Learner [for online courses]
[modify as needed, or extract to a Course Information module in D2L]
Successful completion of this course includes participation in discussions and completion of ALL assignments. As an underlying principle of online learning, successful achievement of course outcomes requires a willingness to self-reflect and self-regulate. You should also frequently reflect on learning goals, application of outcomes, and how you might apply course concepts in your future career or life in general. For additional tips on succeeding as an online learner, review UWL’s Online Readiness Tutorial.
To do well in any online class begin with the following tasks:
Checklist for Getting Started
1	Review Tips for Succeeding in an Online Course (.pdf) if this is your first online class, as well as the Online Readiness Tutorial.

2	Print the Syllabus and read it carefully.
3	Print the Course Outline (schedule). This document should list all readings and assignments, week by week.
4	Click on the button in D2L labeled, Content.
Here you will find course modules (lessons), instructor comments, resources and assignments. 
5	Every time you login check the News area (Course Home) and the General Question & Answer Forum (if available) for important course-related news.
Netiquette
Netiquette is a combination of ‘net’ (from Internet or Network) and ‘etiquette’ and refers to acceptable Internet behavior. It means respecting others’ views and opinions and displaying common courtesy when posting your views and opinions online in discussion forums, email, blogs, and social networking sites, etc. This type of communication does not allow each person to see facial expressions, body language, or hear intonation so it's especially important to watch what and how we say things online. By following netiquette, online communication becomes clearer and helps you maintain and establish positive online relationships as well as develop a positive online reputation.
All class members should abide by these six simple rules (abridged and modified from the 10 rules of Albion.com):
1.	Be kind and forgiving of mistakes (i.e. do unto others as you'd have others do unto you)
2.	Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life (i.e. be ethical)
3.	Respect other people's time and bandwidth (i.e. avoid long rants and be careful not to monopolize a discussion)
4.	Share expert knowledge (i.e. let others benefit from your insights and experience)
5.	Help keep flame wars under control (i.e. no personal attacks or ongoing attempts to belittle or antagonize others)
6.	Respect other people's privacy
Our Legal Obligations to You [do not edit or add to these 4 statements]
Each course syllabus should contain the following text and/or include a link to this page of statements that reflect UWL's legal obligations to students: https://www.uwlax.edu/info/syllabus/  
Sexual Misconduct  
As an employee of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, I am a mandated reporter of sexual harassment and sexual violence that takes place on campus or otherwise affects the campus community. This means that if I receive detailed or specific information about an incident such as the date, time, location, or identity of the people involved, I am obligated to share this with UWL’s Title IX Coordinator http://www.uwlax.edu/affirmative-action/ in order to enable the university to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and rights of all involved. For students not wishing to make an official report, there are confidential resources available to provide support and discuss the available options. The contact in Student Life is Ingrid Peterson, Violence Prevention Specialist, (608) 785-8062, ipeterson@uwlax.edu. Please see http://www.uwlax.edu/sexual-misconduct for more resources or to file a report. 
Religious Accommodations 
Per the UWL Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/aboutuwlax/#accommodation-religious-beliefs  “any student with a conflict between an academic requirement and any religious observance must be given an alternative means of meeting the academic requirement. The student must notify the instructor within the first three weeks of class (within the first week of summer session and short courses) of specific days/dates for which the student will request an accommodation.  Instructors may schedule a make-up examination or other academic requirement before or after the regularly scheduled examination or other academic requirement.”   
Students with Disabilities  
Any student with a documented disability (e.g. ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Acquired Brain Injury, PTSD, Physical, Sensory, Psychological, or Learning Disability) who needs to arrange academic accommodations must contact The ACCESS Center (165 Murphy Library, 608-785-6900, ACCESSCenter@uwlax.edu) and meet with an advisor to register and develop an accommodation plan.  In addition to registering with The ACCESS Center, it is the student's responsibility to discuss their academic needs with their instructors. 
You can find out more about services available to students with disabilities at The ACCESS Center website: http://www.uwlax.edu/access-center  
Veterans and Active Military Personnel 
Veterans and active military personnel with special circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill requirements, disabilities) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to me. For additional information and assistance, contact the Veterans Services Office. http://www.uwlax.edu/veteran-services/. Students who need to withdraw from class or from the university due to military orders should be aware of the military duty withdrawal policy http://catalog.uwlax.edu/undergraduate/academicpolicies/withdrawal/#military-duty-withdrawal-university.
Course Outline & Schedule 
Please note that the timing of activities and topics listed below may change. I will give you timely notice of any major changes in the syllabus by these processes: [explain how you will notify, e.g., through email, on D2L, in class, or some combination of methods].
