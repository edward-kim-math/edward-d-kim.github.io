We are considering an infinite series of the form \( \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{p(n)}{n!} \) where \(p(n)\) is a polynomial in \(n\).
The code below will compute a partial sum (going up to the 90th term) and then "guess" at which multiple of \(e\) we have.
<div class="sage">
<script type="text/x-sage">
var('n')
term = (9*n^4 + 3*n^2 - 9)/factorial(n)
totalup = 0
for k in range(90):
    if k > 0:
        termtoadd = term.subs(n=k)
        totalup = totalup + termtoadd
partialsum = totalup
multipleofe = totalup/e.n()
#print "Approximate sum of series is ", totalup.n()
#print "Above divided be e is ", totalup/e.n()
print "$\sum_{n=1}^\infty " + latex(term) + "$ is approximately $" + latex(partialsum.n()) + "$ which is about $" + multipleofe + "e$."
</script>
