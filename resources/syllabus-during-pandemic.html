title: Things in my syllabus during a pandemic
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

Some things I'd like to share with anyone who is teaching (at any level), take a deep breath. Reach out when you need something. Let me know if I can help. At UWL, we are using Canvas (and to minimize the number of different places students have to go, I am actually formatting my syllabus on the 'Syllabus' page of Canvas). With thanks to so many people (Heather Hulett, Ashley Hanna Edwards, Kristin Wurster Koepke, Nathan Warnberg, Nese Nsf, Bryan Kopp, Kate Parker, Austin Klum, and apologies to those I forgot to mention) I have the following things in my syllabus due to the pandemic. Please take what you need to (no need to credit me in your syllabus -- in fact please don't: that would be confusing for your students). Some of this is UWL-only, but might inspire you to change it for your needs. On these points below, sometimes I'm writing directly to you (my FB audience) and other times I'm just quoting my syllabus:
<ol>
<li>Please note that you won't be physically showing up to class all four days. On the Canvas home screen for this course, you will see which two days of the week you should physically come to class: the information will be displayed right under Course Groups in the column on the right.</li>
<li>Physical Office hours: By appointment (by emailing, you can request to meet for office hours in-person as long as both you and I are healthy and practicing Covid-safe guidelines). Things can unpredictably change, but as I write this (July 2020), if you request, I would meet with you one-on-one in my office with the door open, or meet on-campus in an outdoor setting (picnic table by the library, in one of the gazebos on campus, etc.) if weather permits.</li>
<li>To join virtual office hours, use the link [redacted from FB post] or call [redacted] and enter PIN [redacted].</li>
<li>The most ideal way to ask your math question in office hours is to turn on your device's camera and point it at a sheet of paper showing your work so far. If that is not an option, then we will set up a Google Document which you and I can both write in: the Google Doc will serve as a whiteboard, while the audio conversation will either happen through the videoconferencing system or telephone.</li>
<li>Murphy Learning Center: your student fees pay for a drop-in tutoring center which will be accessed online for Fall 2020. If you can't make my drop-in office hours for math help, you're always welcome to e-mail me to schedule an appointment, but in case timing (or seeing a peer tutor instead of the instructor is your preference), starting the 2nd week of classes, you can access the Murphy Learning Center online in Canvas at http://uwlac.instructure.com/enroll/B3HY3G</li>
<li>Added a section called 'Ways to contact me' which lists every way that I think a student can get a hold of me (two videoconferencing options with links and info on accessing these webconference spaces by phone, my office phone number, my e-mail address)</li>
<li>This textbook will be available from Textbook Rental. For Fall 2020, you need to schedule an appointment with Textbook Rental in advance at http://www.uwlax.edu/go/textbook-appt</li>
<li>The ongoing pandemic may have you needing to make some rapid changes in location. If you find yourself in a situation where you do not have your textbook with you but need a written resource, I recommend looking at the first 14 chapters of this free online textbook: https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m120/TheBook/precalTB2019.pdf</li>
<li>A section on daily expectations/routine and weekly expectations/routine. Normally, in face-to-face, I feel it takes students a couple weeks to get used to the rhythm of what's due on a Wednesday etc. I feel that I'd like to shave that time off in our virtual setting. So, though the info about what's due on what day of the week is elsewhere in my syllabus, reading through these sections should give my students a general overview of the rhythm of my class.</li>
<ul>
<li>Daily expectations: each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, there will be new math material. So, for each of these four days of the week, study the class slides linked to that day (see schedule attached in Canvas). As part of your active learning of this material, there is a brief Interactive Question mentioned in each days' worth of slides. Answering the question is not intended to take a long time (since this is daily). You should answer this question in Canvas, as this counts towards participation credit. You can work ahead if you'd like, but your answer to the Interactive Question is due on a daily basis to try to make sure you don't procrastinate. If something serious comes up and you need an extension on the Interactive Question, please contact me. I will generally grant an extension, but not if things become a habit. (The thing about asynchronous lessons is meant to help create flexibility for you, but the downside is that it's easy to say, "oh, I can do asynchronous stuff any time, so I'll just do it later" but then too much work piles up if you procrastinate because you weren't in the mood to work. The purpose of an Interactive Question due daily is to try to prevent that. At the same time, if you get really sick or some other serious issue comes up, just let me know and I'll extend the due date.)</li>
<li>Weekly expectations: at least once a week (on Sunday afternoons, and perhaps another one mid-week), I will post a video to provide announcements, clarify anything that's confusing in terms of course policy/logistics, and to discuss the math that people have the most confusion on. Homework is due daily using WeBWorK, and quizzes are administered weekly. Besides the 4 interactive questions per week (which count towards the participation grade), there may be other assignments counting towards the participation grade which address things like growth mindset and visiting office hours for math help and so on. Because these will be a little more sporadic, reminders will be made in announcements.</li>
</ul>
<li>I have my university's required COVID-19 health statement. If you're curious what UWL's statement is, click here: https://www.uwlax.edu/info/syllabus/</li>
<li>Our basic needs remain crucial to our success. For students needing support with groceries, day to day food, a safe and stable place to live, and so forth, you are urged to contact Student Life (https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/), the UWL Emergency Resources webpage (https://www.uwlax.edu/student-life/emergency-resources/)
, the Campus Food Pantry (https://www.uwlax.edu/university-centers/services/campus-food-pantry/), and the Campus Clothing Closet (https://www.uwlax.edu/globalassets/offices-services/it-make%24-cents/affording-college/campus-thread.pdf). Furthermore, you may always reach out to me if you feel comfortable, and I will do my best to connect you to additional resources.</li>
<li>12. Compassionate course policy. In my own syllabus this is broken into multiple paragraphs, but I condensed the formatting for this post: While I wish that none of you would have to endure a traumatic situation throughout the semester, the difficult reality that I recognize is that things will come up. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are all real. Large, impactful events occur in the lives of students. In addition, the ongoing pandemic creates a number of circumstances which I recognize will be unpredictable and perhaps even unimaginable from my standpoint as your instructor, including unsafe living situations, needing to care for someone who is ill, unique needs regarding finances/employment, unique circumstances regarding childcare (including [possibly] for siblings/etc.), interruptions to your study time/space, sudden disruptions to equipment/time/space/internet/etc., inadequate study space, and falling ill yourself. Moreover, I recognize that long-term physical distancing itself, the changes in format to so many things (school, work, home, friendships, family, etc.) that you did not ask for, and feelings of isolation adversely affect mental health. I do not wish any of these things upon you, but the reality is that I anticipate there will be many instances of needing to invoke this policy. If any situation arises, I am committed to connecting you to resources available on campus, and within the classroom policies, I will determine if and how to amend class components/policies to create an equitable situation: typically (though not always) this may come in the form of some sort of due date extension. There is a fine balance between ensuring that students are not merely trying to take advantage of a compassionate course clause (due to mismanaging time) versus a truly extenuating circumstance that a student has. As such, I will review any requests related to the compassionate course clause on a case-by-case basis. While this will never be perfect, my hope is to minimize negative impacts on your success in this class caused by trauma, emergency events, and/or mental health concerns as much as I reasonably can. This compassionate course clause is intended to allow for course policy accommodations that are commensurate to any given situation, while still maintaining high academic standards through assessment of course learning outcomes.</li>
</ol>
This post is not about me trying to make myself look good. It's just every meaningful conversation I've had has kept adding to this. It's a lot of ideas from lots of people. I've benefited from conversations that I've had. You (and by extension, your students) should too!
